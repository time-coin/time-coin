# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that is no longer actively used but preserved for historical reference.

## Directory Structure

### `/completed-implementations/`
Implementation completion reports for features that have been successfully integrated into the codebase.

**Contents:**
- `background-task-consolidation-complete.md` - Background task consolidation (2025-12-01)
- `ephemeral-port-optimization-complete.md` - Ephemeral port normalization (2025-12-01)
- `rate-limiter-optimization-complete.md` - Rate limiter optimization (2025-12-01)
- `split-tcp-streams-complete.md` - TCP stream splitting (2025-12-01)
- `unified-pool-implementation-complete.md` - Unified connection pool (2025-12-01)
- `tcp-keepalive-fix.md` - TCP keep-alive fix for consensus (2025-11-28)

These features are now part of the production codebase. The implementation details are documented in the relevant technical specifications.

### `/planning/`
Planning and progress tracking documents for completed consolidation efforts.

**Contents:**
- `CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` - Documentation consolidation plan
- `CONSOLIDATION_PROGRESS.md` - Consolidation progress tracking

These documents were used during the documentation consolidation effort and are now complete. The consolidated guides are in the main docs directory.

### `/submissions/`
Academic submission materials and communication documents.

**Contents:**
- `ARXIV_SUBMISSION.md` - arXiv submission information
- `SUBMISSION_PACKAGE.md` - Academic submission package details
- `SOCIAL_MEDIA_ANNOUNCEMENTS.md` - Social media announcement templates
- `RESEARCHER_CONTACTS.md` - Researcher contact information

These documents were used for academic submissions and outreach efforts.

## Why Archive?

These documents have been archived because:

1. **Completed Implementations**: Features are now integrated and documented in main technical specs
2. **Planning Complete**: Consolidation efforts finished, results available in current docs
3. **Historical Interest**: Preserved for reference but not needed for current development
4. **Reduced Clutter**: Keeps main documentation directory focused on active, relevant content
