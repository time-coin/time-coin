## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Don't spam researchers (personalize each email!)
- Don't ignore negative feedback (engage constructively)
- Don't oversell or hype (be honest about limitations)
- Don't submit to arXiv with errors (proofread carefully)
- Don't contact everyone at once (pace your outreach)

### ✅ Do This Instead
- Personalize every researcher email
- Thank reviewers for critical feedback
- Be honest about trade-offs and limitations
- Have 2-3 people proofread arXiv submission
- Contact in tiers, adjust based on feedback
