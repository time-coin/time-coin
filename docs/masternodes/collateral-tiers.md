# Masternode Collateral Tiers

## ROI Calculator

Example annual rewards (all at ~18.5% APY):

| Tier | Collateral | APY | Voting Power | Est. Annual Reward |
|------|------------|-----|--------------|-------------------|
| Free | 0 | N/A | 0 | ~0.19 TIME |
| Bronze | 1,000 | ~18.5% | 1x | ~185 TIME |
| Silver | 10,000 | ~18.5% | 10x | ~1,850 TIME |
| Gold | 100,000 | ~18.5% | 100x | ~18,500 TIME |

*APY stays constant due to proportional reward weights. Absolute rewards scale with collateral.*

## Why Same APY is Fair

**Problem with tiered APY:** Higher tiers would get unfairly better returns per TIME invested.

**Solution:** Reward weights are proportional to collateral:
- Bronze weight = 1,000 (matches 1,000 TIME collateral)
- Silver weight = 10,000 (matches 10,000 TIME collateral)  
- Gold weight = 100,000 (matches 100,000 TIME collateral)

**Result:** Everyone earns ~18.5% APY regardless of tier. Higher tiers earn more TIME in absolute terms, but same percentage return.

## Choosing Your Tier

Consider:
1. **Budget:** How much can you lock?
2. **Commitment:** Higher tiers = longer commitment
3. **Governance:** Want more voting power?
4. **Risk Tolerance:** Higher amount = more at stake

## Upgrading Tiers

You can upgrade by:
1. Adding more collateral
2. Registering new masternode
3. Old tier automatically deactivated

## Downgrading

To downgrade:
1. Deregister current masternode
2. Wait for cooldown period (30 days)
3. Register with lower tier
