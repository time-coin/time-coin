## Security Overview

TIME Coin employs defense-in-depth security across multiple layers:

**Security Layers:**
1. **Cryptographic Layer**: Ed25519 signatures, SHA3-256 hashing
2. **Consensus Layer**: Byzantine Fault Tolerant with economic security
3. **Network Layer**: Distributed masternodes, geographic diversity
4. **Economic Layer**: Collateral requirements, slashing penalties
5. **Application Layer**: Nonce system, state synchronization, rate limiting

**Security Philosophy:**
- **Assume Malicious Actors**: Design for 33% adversarial network
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple independent security mechanisms
- **Economic Disincentives**: Make attacks cost-prohibitive
- **Transparent Operations**: All actions auditable on-chain
- **Community Oversight**: Governance reviews security decisions

---

## Consensus Security

### Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus

**Core Security Properties:**

**Safety**: Network cannot confirm conflicting transactions
- Requires 67% agreement of selected quorum
- Mathematical guarantee of consistency
- Any two quorums overlap sufficiently to prevent conflicts

**Liveness**: Network always makes progress
- As long as >67% of network is honest and online
- No deadlock scenarios
- Automatic recovery from partitions

**Finality**: Confirmations are immediate and irreversible
- No probabilistic finality (unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- No possibility of transaction reversal
- No chain reorganizations

### Dynamic Quorum Selection

**Scalability Without Compromising Security:**

```
Network Size → Quorum Size → % of Network → Finality Time
100 nodes    → 50 nodes    → 50%          → <1 second
1,000 nodes  → 150 nodes   → 15%          → <2 seconds
10,000 nodes → 300 nodes   → 3%           → <2 seconds
100,000 nodes→ 500 nodes   → 0.5%         → <3 seconds
```

**Selection Algorithm:**
- VRF (Verifiable Random Function) based selection
- Weighted by tier × longevity
- Rotates per transaction
- Unpredictable to attackers

**Security Analysis:**

With 40% malicious stake in network:
- Probability of controlling 67% of 150-node quorum: <0.001%
- Probability of controlling 67% of 300-node quorum: <0.0001%
- Would need thousands of attempts to succeed once
- Daily block validation catches any anomalies

**Protection Mechanisms:**
1. Random selection prevents targeted attacks
2. Weighted selection favors reliable long-term operators
3. VRF ensures verifiable randomness
4. Full network validates daily blocks (additional security layer)

### Weighted Voting Security

**Tier-Based Weights:**
- Bronze (1,000 TIME): 1× voting power
- Silver (10,000 TIME): 10× voting power
- Gold (100,000 TIME): 100× voting power

**Longevity Multiplier:**
- New node: 1.0× multiplier
- 1 year: 1.5× multiplier
- 2 years: 2.0× multiplier
- 4+ years: 3.0× multiplier

**Attack Cost Analysis:**

To control 67% of network weight with 1,000 total nodes:
```
Scenario A: All Bronze (avg weight: 1.5 due to longevity)
- Total network weight: 1,500
- Need 67% = 1,005 weight
- Cost: 670 nodes × 1,000 TIME = 670,000 TIME
- At $5/TIME: $3,350,000

Scenario B: Mixed tiers (realistic distribution)
- 700 Bronze (1.5× avg) = 1,050 weight
- 250 Silver (1.5× avg) = 3,750 weight
- 50 Gold (1.5× avg) = 7,500 weight
- Total: 12,300 weight
- Need 67% = 8,241 weight
- Cheapest: Buy 82 Gold nodes = 8,200,000 TIME
- At $5/TIME: $41,000,000

Scenario C: Attack transaction quorum (300 nodes selected)
- Need 67% of 300 = 201 nodes
- But selection is random and weighted
- With 40% total stake: <0.0001% success per transaction
- Network-wide: Daily block catches anomalies immediately
```

**Economic Security:**
- Attacking is extremely expensive ($3M - $40M+)
- Attack success crashes token price
- Attacker loses entire investment
- Additional slashing penalties
- **Result**: Economically irrational

---

## Double-Spend Prevention

### Multi-Layer Protection

TIME implements **five independent layers** preventing double-spending:

### Layer 1: Nonce System (Primary Defense)

**Sequential Transaction Ordering:**

```rust
// Each account maintains a nonce counter
struct Account {
    address: Address,
    balance: u64,
    nonce: u64,  // Current transaction count
}

// Transaction must use next nonce
struct Transaction {
    from: Address,
    to: Address,
    amount: u64,
    nonce: u64,  // Must be account.nonce + 1
    signature: Signature,
}
```

**How It Prevents Double-Spending:**

```
Account State: Balance=100 TIME, Nonce=5

Attack Attempt:
T=0: Submit TX1 (100 TIME to Alice, nonce=6)
     → Valid: nonce=6 is next in sequence ✅
     → Balance updated: 0 TIME
     → Account nonce updated: 6

T=1: Submit TX2 (100 TIME to Bob, nonce=6)
     → Invalid: nonce=6 already used ❌
     → Rejected immediately
     
     Alternative:
     → Invalid: nonce=7 but expecting 7 ❌
     → Wrong sequence, rejected

Result: Only one transaction can use nonce=6
        Double-spend mathematically impossible
```

**Security Properties:**
- ✅ Cryptographically enforced ordering
- ✅ Cannot reuse nonces (checked on-chain)
- ✅ Cannot skip nonces (must be sequential)
- ✅ Provides total ordering of all account transactions
- ✅ Independent of consensus mechanism

### Layer 2: Global State Synchronization

**Real-Time State Updates:**

```
Transaction Confirmed (BFT Consensus)
        ↓
State Update (Balance, Nonce)
        ↓
Broadcast to ALL Nodes (<500ms)
        ↓
All Nodes Update Local State
        ↓
Next Transaction Sees Updated State
```

**Attack Timeline:**

```
T=0.000s: TX1 submitted (100 TIME to Alice)
T=0.100s: Quorum 1 validates TX1
T=0.500s: TX1 confirmed, state updated
T=0.501s: Balance=0, Nonce=6 broadcast
T=0.600s: ALL nodes have updated state

T=0.650s: Attacker submits TX2 (100 TIME to Bob)
T=0.651s: Pre-validation checks:
          - Balance check: 0 TIME available ❌
          - Nonce check: 6 already used ❌
          → TX2 rejected before entering quorum
```

**Key Insight:** State propagation (<500ms) is faster than typical transaction submission time. Can't race the network.

### Layer 3: Mempool Broadcasting

**Shared Transaction Pool:**

```
Transaction Submitted
        ↓
Broadcast to All Nodes (P2P network)
        ↓
Enters Mempool (Pending transactions)
        ↓
All Nodes See Pending Transaction
        ↓
Conflicting Transactions Detected Immediately
```

**Conflict Detection:**

```rust
// Mempool maintains map of pending transactions
struct Mempool {
    pending: HashMap<(Address, u64), Transaction>,  // (address, nonce) → tx
}

// Check for conflicts before adding
fn add_transaction(tx: Transaction) -> Result<()> {
    let key = (tx.from, tx.nonce);
    
    if self.pending.contains_key(&key) {
        return Err("Nonce already used in mempool");
    }
    
    if tx.nonce != current_account_nonce + 1 {
        return Err("Invalid nonce sequence");
    }
    
    self.pending.insert(key, tx);
    Ok(())
}
```

### Layer 4: BFT Instant Finality

**Consensus Guarantees:**

```
Transaction Validation Process:
1. Signature verification
2. Balance check
3. Nonce verification
4. Mempool conflict check
5. BFT voting round (67% agreement required)
6. Immediate confirmation
7. Irreversible finality

Once Confirmed:
- Cannot be reversed
- No probabilistic finality
- No chain reorganization possible
- Permanent and immutable
```

### Layer 5: Daily Block Validation

**Additional Security Layer:**

```
Every 24 Hours:
1. All confirmed transactions aggregated
2. Full network validates (not just quorum)
3. State transitions re-verified
4. 80% of network must sign block
5. Permanent on-chain record

Additional Security:
- Catches any quorum anomalies (impossible but verified anyway)
- Provides historical audit trail
- Full network consensus on daily state
- Multiple-hour window for detection
```

### Double-Spend Attack Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Basic Double-Spend Attempt**

```
Attacker: 100 TIME balance, nonce=5

Attack:
- Submit TX1: 100 TIME to Merchant A, nonce=6
- Submit TX2: 100 TIME to Merchant B, nonce=6

Defense:
- TX1 enters network first (even by milliseconds)
- TX1 updates state: Balance=0, Nonce=6
- TX2 pre-validation: Balance=0 ❌ OR Nonce=6 used ❌
- TX2 rejected immediately

Result: Failed in <1 second
```

**Scenario 2: Parallel Submission to Different Quorums**

```
Attacker: 100 TIME, submits TX1 and TX2 simultaneously

Attack:
- TX1 → Quorum 1 (100 TIME to Merchant A, nonce=6)
- TX2 → Quorum 2 (100 TIME to Merchant B, nonce=6)
- Hope both quorums validate before seeing each other

Defense:
- Both transactions broadcast network-wide immediately
- Both enter shared mempool
- Second transaction sees conflict in mempool
- Only first transaction proceeds to validation
- Second rejected: "Nonce already in mempool"

Result: Failed in mempool stage
```

**Scenario 3: Network Partition Attack**

```
Attacker: Creates network split, submits different TX to each partition

Attack:
- Network splits into Partition A and Partition B
- Submit TX1 to Partition A (100 TIME to Merchant A)
- Submit TX2 to Partition B (100 TIME to Merchant B)
- Both confirm in isolated partitions

Defense:
- Each partition maintains transaction consistency
- When partitions reconnect:
  * Both transactions have same nonce=6
  * Nonce ordering provides deterministic resolution
  * Lower timestamp wins (TX1 or TX2, but not both)
  * Losing transaction marked invalid
  * Merchant in minority partition notified

Merchant Protection:
- Large transactions (>$10K) wait for daily settlement
- Small transactions (<$100) accept risk (like credit cards)
- Medium transactions wait 5-10 minutes (partition reconnect time)

Result: Network heals deterministically
```

**Scenario 4: 67% Attack on Single Quorum**

```
Attacker: Controls 67% of specific quorum through:
- Extreme luck (probability <0.001% with 40% stake)
- OR 67% of total network (cost: $40M+)

Attack:
- Force malicious quorum to confirm invalid transaction
- Double-spend the same funds

Defense:
- Daily block validation by FULL network (not just quorum)
- 80% of total network must sign block
- Invalid transactions rejected at block level
- Malicious quorum detected and slashed
- Transaction reversed before settlement

Cost vs Benefit:
- Cost: $40M+ in collateral
- Benefit: Steal up to 1 day of transactions
- Risk: Total collateral loss + network ban
- Token price crashes → investment worthless

Result: Economically irrational, caught within 24 hours
```

### Security Guarantees

**Mathematical Guarantee:**
With nonce system + BFT consensus + state synchronization:
- ✅ Double-spending is cryptographically impossible for honest majority
- ✅ Even with 33% malicious nodes, system remains secure
- ✅ Economic security makes 67% attack irrational
- ✅ Multiple independent layers (all must fail simultaneously)

---

## Treasury Security

### Masternode-Controlled Treasury

**Security Model:**

The treasury is controlled by the masternode network through threshold cryptography, not separate keyholders.

**Threshold Signature Scheme:**

```
Treasury Private Key = Cryptographically Split
                       ↓
Key Share 1 → Masternode 1
Key Share 2 → Masternode 2
Key Share 3 → Masternode 3
...
Key Share N → Masternode N

To Sign Transaction:
- Requires T of N shares (e.g., 670 of 1,000)
- No single node knows full key
- Shares automatically distributed
- Exiting nodes lose shares automatically
```

**Security Properties:**

**Attack Requirements:**
To steal from treasury:
1. Compromise 670+ independent masternode operators
2. Each operator geographically distributed
3. Most operators pseudonymous (harder to target)
4. Each has 50,000+ TIME collateral at stake
5. Simultaneously compromise all 670+ servers
6. Bypass 24-48 hour time locks
7. Avoid detection by monitoring systems

**Attack Cost Analysis:**

```
Minimum Requirements:
- 670 Gold masternodes = 33,500,000 TIME collateral
- At $5/TIME = $167,500,000 upfront cost
- Monthly operations: 670 nodes × $300 = $201,000/month
- Technical expertise to compromise 670 distributed servers
- Must avoid detection across 24-48 hour time lock
- Risk: All collateral slashed if detected

Success Probability: <1%
Expected Loss: $167M (collateral) + $201K/month (operations)
Expected Gain: 0 (detected before completion)

Conclusion: Economically impossible
```

**Death/Exit Resilience:**

Unlike traditional multi-signature:
```
Traditional Multi-Sig (5 of 9):
- Keyholder 1 dies → System at risk
- Keyholder 2 dies → Emergency procedures
- Keyholder 3 dies → System may be compromised

TIME Masternode Control (670 of 1,000):
- 100 operators die/exit → System fully operational (900 > 670)
- 200 operators die/exit → System fully operational (800 > 670)
- 300 operators die/exit → System fully operational (700 > 670)
- 350 operators die/exit → Emergency procedures (650 < 670)

System self-heals automatically through natural operator turnover
```

### Operational Security Controls

**Time Locks:**

All treasury operations have mandatory delays:
```
Small Operations (<10K TIME):
- 24-hour time lock
- Community review period
- Automatic execution if no objections

Large Operations (>10K TIME):
- 48-hour time lock
- Enhanced community review
- Governance vote if disputed
- Automatic execution if approved

Emergency Operations:
- 75% threshold (higher than normal 67%)
- 24-hour absolute minimum
- Post-action review required
```

**Rate Limits:**

```
Daily Spending Limits by Category:
- Development: 20% of treasury per month
- Security: 15% of treasury per month
- Marketing: 10% of treasury per month
- Operations: 5% of treasury per month

Circuit Breakers:
- Spending >5% of treasury in 24h → Automatic freeze
- Unusual pattern detection → Manual review
- Failed verification → Operations suspended
```

**Monitoring & Alerts:**

```
Automated Monitoring:
- Transaction pattern analysis
- Anomaly detection (ML-based)
- Unusual destination addresses
- Timing anomalies
- Amount outliers

Real-Time Alerts:
- Community watchdogs (designated volunteers)
- Automated notification system
- Public dashboard (all transactions visible)
- Governance notification for large operations
```

### Collateral Custody Security

**Escrow System:**

```
Operator Registration:
1. Operator sends collateral to treasury contract
2. Treasury locks collateral
3. On-chain record: (Operator ID → Collateral Amount)
4. Collateral tracked separately from operating funds

Accounting Separation:
├─ Collateral Account (escrow, returnable)
│  ├─ Tier 1 Pool: 700,000 TIME (700 operators)
│  ├─ Tier 2 Pool: 2,500,000 TIME (250 operators)
│  └─ Tier 3 Pool: 2,500,000 TIME (50 operators)
│
└─ Operating Account (spendable funds)
   ├─ From token creation (2%)
   ├─ From transaction fees (5%)
   └─ From slashing penalties
```

**Security Measures:**

```
Collateral Protection:
- Separate smart contract for escrow
- Cannot be spent by treasury
- Only returnable to owner or slashed
- All movements auditable on-chain
- Time-locked returns (7-14 days)

Operating Fund Protection:
- Threshold signatures (670 of 1,000)
- Time locks (24-48 hours)
- Rate limits and circuit breakers
- Governance approval for large spending
```

## Minting Security

### Purchase-Based Minting Security

**Threat Model:**
Attacker attempts to mint TIME tokens without legitimate payment.

### Gateway Authorization

**Licensed Gateways Only:**

```
Gateway Requirements:
1. KYC/AML compliance
2. $1M+ insurance bond
3. Regular compliance audits
4. Payment processor integration
5. Multi-signature controls
6. Transparent operations

Gateway License Revocation:
- Governance vote (60% threshold)
- Automatic if compliance failures
- Bond forfeited for fraud
```

### Payment Verification Layers

**Layer 1: Cryptographic Proof**

```rust
struct PaymentProof {
    gateway_signature: Signature,    // Gateway's private key
    payment_receipt_hash: Hash,      // Bank receipt OR blockchain TX
    amount: u64,                     // Amount in USD/crypto
    timestamp: u64,                  // Must be <1 hour old
    nonce: u64,                      // Sequential, prevents replay
}

// Verification
fn verify_payment_proof(proof: PaymentProof) -> bool {
    // 1. Verify gateway signature
    if !verify_signature(proof, gateway_public_key) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // 2. Check timestamp freshness
    if now() - proof.timestamp > 3600 {
        return false;  // Stale proof
    }
    
    // 3. Verify nonce not reused
    if nonce_already_used(proof.nonce) {
        return false;  // Replay attack
    }
    
    // 4. For crypto: verify on-chain
    if payment_is_crypto(proof) {
        return verify_blockchain_tx(proof.payment_receipt_hash);
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

**Layer 2: Blockchain Verification (Crypto Payments)**

```
For BTC/ETH/USDC payments:
1. Gateway provides TX hash
2. Masternodes verify on source blockchain
3. Check confirmations (6 for BTC, 12 for ETH)
4. Verify recipient is gateway's known address
5. Verify amount matches exactly
6. Verify TX not previously used for minting

All checks must pass before minting approved
```

**Layer 3: Masternode Verification**

```
Verification Process:
1. Random selection of 5 Tier 2+ KYC masternodes
2. Each independently verifies payment legitimacy
3. Each votes: APPROVE or REJECT
4. Require 4 of 5 approval (80% threshold)
5. Verifiers earn 0.1% of minting amount as fee

Security:
- Random selection prevents targeting
- Weighted by longevity (favors reliable operators)
- Economic incentive for honest verification
- Slashing penalty for false approvals (10% collateral)
```

**Layer 4: Anti-Replay Protection**

```
Nonce Tracking:
- Each gateway maintains sequential nonce
- Each payment proof has unique nonce
- Network tracks all used nonces forever
- Duplicate nonce rejected immediately

Database:
struct NonceRegistry {
    gateway_nonces: HashMap<GatewayID, HashSet<u64>>,
}

// Check before processing
fn check_replay(gateway_id: GatewayID, nonce: u64) -> bool {
    !self.gateway_nonces[gateway_id].contains(&nonce)
}
```

**Layer 5: Rate Limiting**

```
Gateway Limits:
- Daily limit: $1M per gateway (governance-adjustable)
- Per-transaction limit: $100K
- Velocity checks: Maximum 100 TX/hour

User Limits:
- Daily limit: $100K per user
- Per-transaction limit: $50K
- Identity verification required for >$10K

Network Limits:
- Total daily minting: $10M network-wide
- Circuit breaker if exceeded
- Manual review for anomalies
```

### Attack Scenarios & Mitigations

**Scenario 1: Gateway Private Key Compromise**

```
Attack:
- Attacker steals gateway private key
- Attempts to mint free tokens with fake payment proofs

Mitigation:
- Rate limits cap damage to $1M/day
- Masternode verification detects fake receipts
- Anomaly detection flags unusual patterns
- Gateway frozen within hours
- Insurance bond covers losses
- Other gateways unaffected

Maximum Loss: $1M (insurance bond covers it)
Detection Time: <24 hours
```

**Scenario 2: Collusion Between Gateway and Verifiers**

```
Attack:
- Gateway colludes with 4 of 5 random verifiers
- Attempt to approve fake payment

Mitigation:
- Random verifier selection (can't predict who to bribe)
- Need to bribe 80% of verifiers (4 of 5)
- Verifiers have collateral at stake (10K-50K TIME)
- Slashing penalty if caught (10% = 1K-5K TIME)
- Economic cost exceeds benefit
- On-chain evidence of collusion

Probability: <0.01% (need right 4 random verifiers)
Cost: $200K+ in bribes (4 verifiers × 50K potential loss)
Benefit: Limited by daily rate limits ($100K max)
Result: Economically irrational
```

**Scenario 3: Replay Attack**

```
Attack:
- Reuse old payment proof to mint additional tokens

Mitigation:
- Nonce system prevents replay
- Each nonce used exactly once
- Network tracks all historical nonces
- Duplicate immediately rejected

Result: Cryptographically impossible
```

**Scenario 4: Fake Blockchain Transaction**

```
Attack:
- Submit fake BTC/ETH transaction hash

Mitigation:
- Masternodes verify directly on source blockchain
- Check confirmations (6+ blocks)
- Verify recipient address is known gateway address
- Cross-check with multiple blockchain explorers
- Fake TX hash fails verification

Result: Detected immediately by masternode verification
```

### Minting Security Summary

**Defense-in-Depth:**
- 5 independent security layers
- Each layer must be bypassed for successful attack
- Economic incentives align all parties
- Rate limits cap maximum damage
- Insurance covers gateway failures

**Attack Success Probability:** <0.01%
**Maximum Loss per Attack:** $1M (insured)
**Detection Time:** <24 hours

---

## Network Security

### Peer-to-Peer Security

**TLS 1.3 Encryption:**
```
All Node Communication:
- TLS 1.3 mandatory
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Certificate pinning for known nodes
- Regular key rotation
- Mutual authentication
```

**Sybil Attack Prevention:**

```
Collateral Requirements:
- Must lock 1,000-50,000 TIME to participate
- Economic barrier to entry
- Makes mass node creation expensive

Example:
- Create 1,000 fake nodes = 1,000,000 TIME minimum
- At $5/TIME = $5,000,000 cost
- Still only gets 1,000 votes (vs potentially 10,000+ real network)
```

**DDoS Mitigation:**

```
Network Level:
- Geographic distribution of nodes
- Multiple RPC endpoints
- Rate limiting per IP
- Automatic bad actor banning

Consensus Level:
- BFT tolerates 33% offline nodes
- Dynamic quorum adapts to available nodes
- Network continues operating during attacks
```

### Node Authentication

```
Node Registration:
1. Generate Ed25519 keypair
2. Submit collateral transaction
3. Receive unique node ID
4. Join P2P network with signed messages

Message Verification:
- All messages signed by node private key
- Recipients verify signature
- Unknown nodes ignored
- Invalid signatures → temporary ban
```

---

## Cryptographic Foundations

### Hash Function: SHA3-256 (Keccak)

**Properties:**
- 256-bit output
- Collision resistance: 2^256 operations
- Pre-image resistance: Computationally infeasible
- Quantum resistant (NIST standard)

**Usage in TIME:**
```
- Block hashes
- Transaction IDs
- Merkle tree construction
- State root calculation
- VRF seed generation
```

### Signature Scheme: Ed25519 (EdDSA)

**Properties:**
- 64-byte signatures
- Fast verification (~60,000 verifications/second)
- Deterministic (no random number generation vulnerabilities)
- Battle-tested (used by Signal, Tor, SSH)

**Security:**
- 128-bit security level
- Signature forgery: Computationally infeasible
- Private key recovery: Impossible without quantum computer

**Usage:**
```rust
// Transaction signing
struct Transaction {
    data: TransactionData,
    signature: ed25519::Signature,  // 64 bytes
}

// Verification
fn verify(tx: Transaction, public_key: PublicKey) -> bool {
    ed25519::verify(&tx.data, &tx.signature, &public_key)
}
```

### Address Format

```
TIME Address Format:
- Version byte: 0x4D ('TIME')
- Public key hash: 20 bytes (RIPEMD-160 of SHA3-256)
- Checksum: 4 bytes
- Encoded: Base58Check

Example: TIME1a2B3c4D5e6F7g8H9i0J1k2L3m4N5o6P7

Security:
- Address ≠ public key (hash provides additional security)
- Checksum prevents typos
- 160-bit security (2^160 possible addresses)
```

### Merkle Trees

```
Transaction Set → Merkle Tree → Root Hash

           Root
          /    \
        Hash1  Hash2
       /  \    /  \
     Tx1 Tx2 Tx3 Tx4

Benefits:
- Efficient verification (log N)
- Tamper-proof
- Light client support
- Efficient synchronization
```

## Attack Vectors & Mitigations

### 51% Attack (67% in BFT)

**Attack Cost:**

```
Network State: 1,000 masternodes
Total Weight: 12,300 (mixed tiers with longevity)

Attack Requirement: 67% = 8,241 weight

Cheapest Path:
- Buy 82 Gold nodes = 8,200 weight
- Cost: 82 × 50,000 TIME = 4,100,000 TIME
- At $5/TIME: $20,500,000

Monthly Operations:
- 82 nodes × $300/month = $24,600/month

Risk:
- If detected: All collateral slashed
- Token price crashes: Investment worthless
- Network can hard fork: Attack nullified
- Legal liability: Identity may be discovered

Expected Return: Negative (guaranteed loss)
```

**Detection & Response:**

```
Monitoring:
- Unusual voting patterns
- Geographic concentration of new nodes
- Rapid increase in single-entity nodes
- Correlation analysis of node behavior

Response:
- Governance vote to investigate
- Temporary freeze of suspicious nodes
- Collateral slashing if confirmed
- Hard fork if necessary (community vote)
```

### Long-Range Attack

**Attack Description:**
Attacker creates alternate chain from old state.

**TIME's Protection:**

```
BFT Finality:
- Each block signed by 80% of network
- Historical signatures cannot be forged
- New nodes sync from recent checkpoint
- Invalid chains rejected immediately

Checkpointing:
- Daily blocks create natural checkpoints
- Each block requires 80% network signatures
- Cannot rewrite past BFT consensus
- New nodes trust recent checkpoint

Result: Long-range attacks impossible
```

### Network Partition Attack

**Attack Description:**
Split network into isolated segments.

**TIME's Response:**

```
During Partition:
- Each segment maintains consistency
- Transactions confirmed within segment
- Both segments continue operating

After Reconnection:
- Nonce ordering resolves conflicts
- Deterministic conflict resolution
- Lower nonce/timestamp wins
- Losing transactions marked invalid
- Affected parties notified

Merchant Protection:
- Small TX (<$100): Accept immediately
- Medium TX ($100-$10K): Wait 5 minutes
- Large TX (>$10K): Wait for daily settlement

Detection:
- Monitoring detects partition within minutes
- Alerts sent to major merchants
- Automatic reconciliation after reconnect
```

### Eclipse Attack

**Attack Description:**
Isolate specific node from honest network.

**Mitigation:**

```
Node Diversity:
- Maintain connections to geographically diverse peers
- Rotate peer connections regularly
- Prefer long-term reliable peers
- Monitor peer consensus participation

Detection:
- Check block height with multiple sources
- Compare state root with diverse peers
- Alert if isolated from majority

Prevention:
- Require minimum peer diversity (10+ peers)
- Prefer peers from different regions
- Automatic reconnection if peers drop
```

### Whale Manipulation

**Attack Description:**
Large token holder manipulates governance.

**Mitigation:**

```
Vote Distribution:
- Even 100 Gold nodes = only 30,000 weight (with 3× longevity)
- Network of 1,000 nodes = 12,300+ total weight
- Single whale needs 67% = 8,241 weight
- Cost: $20M+ in collateral

Longevity Requirement:
- Maximum 3× multiplier
- Takes 4 years to reach
- Cannot quickly accumulate voting power
- Long-term commitment required

Proposal Requirements:
- 60% approval threshold
- 60% quorum requirement
- 14-day discussion period
- Community oversight

Result: Even whales must convince community
```

### Slashing Evasion

**Attack Description:**
Operator tries to avoid slashing penalties.

**Detection:**

```
Cryptographic Proof:
- Double-signing leaves cryptographic evidence
- Cannot forge or hide signatures
- Proof submitted by any node
- Automatic slashing on verification

Network Monitoring:
- All nodes monitor for violations
- Bounty for reporting (100 TIME)
- Evidence stored permanently on-chain
- Cannot escape detection

Slashing Execution:
- Automatic penalty calculation
- Treasury holds collateral (can't withdraw)
- On-chain record of violation
- Appeal period (14 days) before finalization
```
