feat: migrate node communication to TCP-only protocol

Convert all node-to-node communication from mixed HTTP/TCP to pure TCP
using existing connections. This improves security, reduces latency,
and simplifies the network protocol.

Changes:
- Add 10 new TCP message types for full protocol coverage
- Convert request_genesis(), request_mempool(), request_blockchain_info(),
  request_snapshot(), and fetch_peers_from_api() from HTTP to TCP
- Remove HTTP fallbacks from broadcast_block_proposal() and
  broadcast_block_vote()
- Convert peer discovery broadcasts from HTTP to TCP
- Convert transaction proposal/vote broadcasts from HTTP to TCP
- Make send_to_peer_tcp() public for external module access
- Fix pre-existing bug in block_producer.rs (block.header.hash -> block.hash)

HTTP is now only used for:
- External peer discovery from time-coin.io (bootstrapping)
- Local CLI/GUI tools connecting to localhost API
- Monitoring dashboards (localhost connections)

Benefits:
- Enhanced security: eliminates HTTP endpoints between nodes
- Improved efficiency: reuses established TCP connections
- Reduced latency: no HTTP connection setup/teardown overhead
- Simplified protocol: single communication method for node-to-node
- Better reliability: TCP guaranteed delivery with error handling

Documentation:
- TCP_ONLY_MIGRATION.md - complete migration documentation
- TCP_MESSAGE_HANDLERS_TODO.md - implementation guide for Phase 2

Phase 2 TODO:
- Implement TCP message handlers in node event loop
- Test all message types end-to-end
